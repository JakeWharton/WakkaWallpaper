			<h1>1.0.0 RC3 <em>(In Development)</em></h1>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Draw the entirety of the ghost body path as we can't rely on it automatically linking the final two segments when the entities style is stroke.</li>
				<li>When the entity style is set to stroke ensure the warning blink when frightened is also drawn in that style.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h1>1.0.0 RC2 <em>(2010-08-04)</em></h1>
			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Increased row and column maximum to 8 to match ADW.Launcher maximums.</li>
				<li>Add ability to draw walls around icons to match the iOS static wallpaper (<em>thanks <a href="">chazam</a>!</em>). Due to the slight but deliberate misalignment of the grid by default as a tradeoff between edge visibility and icon alignment, the walls will not perfectly surround your icons. You can adjust the "Grid Padding" settings under "Display" to tweak the alignment to your liking.</li>   
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Importing of old or partial JSONs will no longer cause a force close.</li>

			<h1>1.0.0 beta 3 <em>(2010-07-25)</em></h1>
			<h2>New Features:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Tapping the top, bottom, left, or right of your screen will influence The Man's direction. If you tap a direction, he will attempt to change to that direction every time he moves until he hits a wall. If he successfully changes direction he will continue going that direction until he hits a wall. If he hit a wall while going the current direction and was unable to change to your desired direction the AI will choose a new direction and your desired direction will be cleared. This does not yet work in landscape. The directions are calculated based off of the center of your screen and not The Man's location. Even though you may be tapping to The Man's left, if it is to the right of the screen center he will go right.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Bug Fixes:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Ghosts, The Man, Fruit, and "Ready"/"Game Over" text now rotate when in landscape.</li>
